1. Create a program to analyze a large block of text and report back on the frequency of
each word in the text.
a. Start by sorting the text into a hash where each word is a key with the word’s
value being the amount of times it has been used in the block:
{the: 10, john: 1, of: 15}
b. Once you’ve created this hash, return the word that has been used the most
c. When you’re done, encapsulate your script inside of a method that can analyze
any block of text fed to it
